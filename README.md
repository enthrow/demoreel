# ðŸŽ¬ DemoReel

This is a [PyO3] module that parses .dem packet traces (demo-files) generated by
Source games using [demostf/parser][demostf], yields them as Python objects, and rolls
wheels using [maturin], motivated by the need for integration into
[MAC/Jensen][jensen].

Using this library, data storage and annotation can be decoupled from the batch
processing of the demo-files, avoiding the introduction of a domain-specific
format for training of AI models, and hopefully helping separate the concerns of
individual applications consuming such data from the pipelines producing and
ingesting it. 

## Installation

Haha, you thought. Nah, but this is actually a build section. You can only
install from source.

in the project root:
```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv # optional: create a virtual environment
$ . venv/bin/activate  # you can also activate a different one obviously
$ pip install maturin
$ maturin develop --release  # this should automatically build and install a wheel for you
```

This will build a wheel in the `targets/` subdirectory that you can `pip
install` in other virtual environments. Or if you prefer, you can just run your
application code in this source tree. Go ahead. I'm not the file police.

## Python Usage

```py
import demoreel

demo_path = REPLACE_ME
with open(demo_path, "rb") as istrm:
    octets = istrm.read()

# all game events, map boundaries, player states, and instances of damage
dtrace = demoreel.dtrace(octets)  
```

### TODO
- reassess automatic state integration
  - dumping an entire state representation is really large
  - maybe it's better to just publish sparse state _updates_ (e.g., hurt events)
